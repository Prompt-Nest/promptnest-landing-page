            Privacy Policy for PromptNest (Chrome Extension)

            PromptNest collects and stores your email address to manage your account and determine Pro subscription status.

            We use Stripe to process payments. Stripe may collect payment-related information, but PromptNest does not store any credit card or billing details directly.

            We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties. Data is only used to provide the features of the extension.

            If you have any questions or wish to delete your account, contact: [your email]

            This policy may be updated at any time. Continued use of the extension indicates acceptance of any changes.
